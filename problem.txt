Define a function RemoveDuplicate(nlist) to remove duplicate elements from list.

Here are some examples:

[] -> []

[1,2] -> [1,2]

[1,1,2,2,3,3] -> [1,2,3]

EXTRA FROM ME:
Make a function that makes a random array of a certain length,
with values between a certain amount.
Repetition ratio of 1 = length/valuespan. means that the elements never repeat.
array of length 10, with values between 1 and 5 
- means that values are likely to repeat twice, 10/5 = 2
